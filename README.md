## Steps


## Task 1: Deploy zone-resilient Azure virtual machines by using the Azure portal

In this task, I will deploy two Azure virtual machines into different availability zones by using the Azure portal. Availability zones offer the highest level of uptime SLA for virtual machines at 99.99%. To achieve this SLA, you must deploy at least two virtual machines across different availability zones.

1.	Sign in to the Azure portal - https://portal.azure.com.
2.	Search for and select Virtual machines, on the Virtual machines blade, click + Create, and then select in the drop-down Azure virtual machine. Notice your other choices.

## Task 2: Manage compute and storage scaling for virtual machines

In this task, I will scale a virtual machine by adjusting its size to a different SKU. Azure provides flexibility in VM size selection so that you can adjust a VM for periods of time if it needs more (or less) compute and memory allocated. This concept is extended to disks, where you can modify the performance of the disk, or increase the allocated capacity.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca1244f6-a34a-4aa5-85e5-9c88feb46e12)
 

1.	On the az104-vm1 virtual machine, in the Availability + scale blade, select Size.
2.	Set the virtual machine size to DS1_v2 and click Resize. When prompted, confirm the change.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25378aa3-9903-40da-bf5e-7d395452c05a)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6e5c648-739e-41ca-a55d-5ca363967a18)
  
Resizing is also known as vertical scaling, up or down.

## Task 4: Scale Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets
In this task, you scale the virtual machine scale set using a custom scale rule.
1.	Select Go to resource or search for and select the vmss1 scale set.
2.	Choose Availability + Scale from the left side menu, then choose Scaling.
Scale out rule
1.	Select Custom autoscale. Then change the Scale mode to Scale based on metric. And then select Add a rule.
2.	Letâ€™s create a rule that automatically increases the number of VM instances. This rule scales out when the average CPU load is greater than 70% over a 10-minute period. When the rule triggers, the number of VM instances is increased by 20%.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b8a5206-79b7-4e21-9932-783fffc92c97)
 
3.	Be sure to Save your changes.
Scale in rule
1.	During evenings or weekends, demand may decrease so it is important to create a scale in rule.
2.	Letâ€™s create a rule that decreases the number of VM instances in a scale set. The number of instances should decrease when the average CPU load drops below 30% over a 10-minute period. When the rule triggers, the number of VM instances is decreased by 20%.
3.	Select Add a rule, adjust the settings, then select Add.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7ea97a1-1ed8-4e83-aefe-8791f6be0bfc)
 
4.	Be sure to Save your changes.

Set the instance limits
1.	When your autoscale rules are applied, instance limits make sure that you do not scale out beyond the maximum number of instances or scale in beyond the minimum number of instances.
2.	Instance limits are shown on the Scaling page after the rules.
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76797ea5-18a9-4fe7-981c-8f8e6162bc41)

3.	Be sure to Save your changes
4.	On the vmss1 page, select Instances. This is where you would monitor the number of virtual machine instances.
